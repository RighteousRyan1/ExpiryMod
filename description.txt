This mod is mainly for people who want a hard challenge for their playthroughs. A quick summary is below!

Have you ever wanted Terraria Master Mode to be more like master mode?
Have you always wanted to make youself suffer?
Fear not! Expiry Mode is for you!

Make each biome an interesting experience with a unique buff/debuff each one gives you!
Hell is even more hellish! Cool!

Some items contradict debuffs around the world. Find em.
Good luck.

NOTE: Added Death Counter per session. Does not go well with dedicated servers.

NOTES:
Please take note that this mod is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
Some issues we have noticed are listed below:
- Death counter does not go well with dedicated servers.
- Expiry Mode does not stay activated in multiplayer servers.
- Sometimes unloading can make the player catch an irreversable exception, forcing the player to close the game. (Only if other main menu music changing mods are enabled)
PLEASE leave any bugs in my discord, linked at the top-right of the screen when the mod is loaded.
