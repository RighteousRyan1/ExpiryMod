This mod is mainly for people who want a hard challenge for their playthroughs. A quick summary is below!

Have you ever wanted Terraria Master Mode to be more like master mode?
Have you always wanted to make youself suffer?
Fear not! Expiry Mode is for you!

Make each biome an interesting experience with a unique buff/debuff each one gives you!
Hell is even more hellish! Cool!

Some items contradict debuffs around the world. Find em.
Good luck.

NOTE: Added Death Counter per session. Does not go well with dedicated servers.
